Dataset Used: https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset

Introduction-
An face emotion recognition system comprises of two step process i.e. face detection in image followed by emotion detection on the detected bounded face. 
The following two techniques are used for respective mentioned tasks in face recognition system.

1. Haar feature-based cascade classifiers : It detects frontal face in an image well. It is real time and faster in comparison to other face detector
2. CNN Model : We have trained a classification CNN model architecture which takes bounded face as input and predicts probabilities of 7 emotions in the output layer.

Applictions of this project-

1. Facial Emotion Detection in Interviews-
A candidate-interviewer interaction is susceptible to many categories of judgment and subjectivity.
Such subjectivity makes it hard to determine whether candidate's personality is a good fit for the job. 
Identifying what a candidate is trying to say is out of our hands because of the multiple layers of language interpretation, cognitive biases, and context that lie in between. That's where this project comes in, which can measure candidate's facial expressions to capture their moods and further assess their personality traits.

2. For Market Research-
Traditional market research companies have employed verbal methods mostly in the form of surveys to find the consumers wants and needs. 
However, such methods assume that consumers can formulate their preferences verbally and the stated preferences correspond to future actions which may not always be right.

Another popular approach in market research industry is to employ behavioral methods that let users act while trying the product. 
Such methods are considered more objective than verbal methods. Behavioral methods use video feeds of a user interacting with the product, and the video is then analyzed manually to observer user's reactions and emotions.
This can quickly become very labor intensive increasing the overall cost. Facial emotion recognition system can automatically detect facial expressions on user's faces and automate the video analysis completely.
Market research companies can use this technology to scale the data collection efforts and rely on the technology to do analysis quickly.


We would like to thank Krish Naik Sir and ineuron team for their discussions and great insights on Open CV and CNN architectures during the Deep Learning course, which helped us 
work on this project.
