Introduction-
An face emotion recognition system comprises of two step process i.e. face detection in image followed by emotion detection on the detected bounded face. 
The following two techniques are used for respective mentioned tasks in face recognition system.

1. Haar feature-based cascade classifiers : It detects frontal face in an image well. It is real time and faster in comparison to other face detector
2. CNN Model : We have trained a classification CNN model architecture which takes bounded face as input and predicts probabilities of 7 emotions in the output layer.

We would like to thank Krish Naik Sir and ineuron team for their discussions and great insights on Open CV and CNN architectures during the Deep Learning course, which helped us 
work on this project.
